	<ul><li class="list1">THE UNDERGROUND CITY</li></ul>
	<p >This shopping mall is located at the very centre of underground Montreal; it is four stories high and home to over 100 stores, a food court, and is host to many cultural events. Connecting through the McGill metro station, it is often considered the city's main artery! This 3 hour food tour through Old Montreal explores the historic parts of the area and dives into the history of Montreal's Underground. The tour stops at 6 different tasting sites, including 4 sit-down restaurants. There's even an opportunity to sample a locally-brewed beer! If learning about the history of Old Montreal and the Underground City while sampling delicious food tickles your fancy.

	<p >Montreal's long gay history dates all the way back to 1869, when one Moise Tellier ran a shop on what's now Saint Antoine Street selling apples and cakes -- but more legendarily was a place for gay gentlemen to rendezvous. A century later in the Stonewall era, most of Montreal's gay life was clustered at the city center along Saint Laurent Boulevard. The 1970s and '80s saw LGBT establishments move eastward en masse, creating today's Gay Village in the mile-or-so stretch of Saint Catherine Street (or Rue Sainte-Catherine) between Berri and Papineau Streets. Here, scores of bars, clubs, shops and restaurants catering to the city's large and diverse LGBT community have been thriving for decades.

	<ul><li class="list1">OLYMPIC PARK</li></ul>
	<p >Built for the 1976 Summer Olympics, the Olympic Park has become one of the most universally recognized Montreal landmarks. Do you want to see Montreal in a new way? Take the funicular to the top of the Tower, where stunning views of the city and its surroundings await! The Olympic Stadium also offers guided tours that will reveal the secrets and history behind this masterpiece of modern architecture. After undergoing major renovations, the Sports Centre now offers you high-tech training spaces and equipment. The Esplanade Financiere Sun Life, located at the foot of the stadium, offers a lively outdoor line-up focused on culture, recreation, and physical activity. Street food from some of Montreal's best food trucks is also available!
	</p>

	<ul><li class="list1">DOWNTOWN</li></ul>
	<p >Downtown has always been identified with Sainte-Catherine Street , Montreal 's renowned commercial thoroughfare. Stretching for 15 kilometers across the city from east to west, the Street is lined with the major department stores, shops and restaurants that have been the pride of Montreal for more than a century. Today, Sainte-Catherine Street is busier than ever, as more and more office towers shoot up all around it, blending with the underground shopping malls to which it connects. No fewer than eight metro stations (the green line running parallel) serve the Street, allowing visitors to discover diverse neighborhoods as they travel along.
